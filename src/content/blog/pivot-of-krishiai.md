I had worked on KrishiAI as my undergrad major project. I realised that I was building something wrong after building a set of features for the app which include

- a plant disease scanner (works for rice only)
- pesticide label scanner
- voice AI with grounding in agriculture knowledge

This made me think what problem does the app really solve? 

### My initial hypothesis

My initial hypothesis was that with better accuracy of vision models and accessibility provided by voice AI interface (with multi-lingual support), the farmers would find it useful. 

I had finalised that the following were the most pressing issues for farmers in India 

1. Lack of access to information (especially about government subsidies and schemes)
2. Unable to identify plant disease at the earliest
3. Low literacy causing issues with understanding the dosage of pesticides

I had talked to around 4-5 farmers withing my network to understand their problems, but there is something that I missed.

### What went wrong

{add yc how to ask questions to users}

another core issue was that I did not approach the problem with a first principles thinking mindset and forgot about the second and third order effects of my product decisions.

Apart from this I was trying to learn app dev on the go (with the help of AI) and vibe coded the whole app. 

### Pivot

When we think about Indian farmers and Agriculture in India, the problems are systemic and need to be solved by state level actors. Not every problem can be solve by an app
