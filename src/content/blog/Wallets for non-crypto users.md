## Introduction

Allowing a generic user to use and experience the crypto and web3 world has always been a challenge due to one specific reason - self-custodial wallet mechanism.

Due to the philosophy behind web3 wave is sovereignty and decentralisation, owning a crypto wallet (often provided by a centralized company like Metamask) has become a norm. 

Is there a way to solve this problem? Enter embedded wallets.

Note: some cryptography concepts explored ahead. Proceed at your own risk!

## If AI written code becomes the norm

For now, if we assume that AI written code is as good as an average developer, reviewing it and sending it into production won't be an issue as long as thoroughly reviewed (which can also be assisted by another specialized model).

This might give rise to interesting behavioral  changes in programming. For starters, all the design pattern that are currently abundant in most of the codebases (more so in languages like JAVA) are tailored to human understanding and easy readability. AI written code need not be restricted to such arbitrary patterns as long as the code works. 

Just as we have gotten used to probabilistic answering nature of LLMs where no one yet completely understands it's working but still it's output can more or less be considered on par with most of junior level coders, we will soon get habituated with having code that you understand less and less but have a high level understanding of what is does. 
## Is programming limited to computers?

OpenAI recently launched their new features like pdf chats, custom GPT builder without code (you can just talk with a base model and create a custom GPT) , etc. What really caught my eye was this new Assistant API which can help you develop autonomous agents that can interact with the world with the help of external API and do things for you like booking your tickets deciding you schedule, planning and execution you wedding, figuring out code deployment and al lot more.

This means that the process of programming and scripting will be completely abstracted away and the only thing that remains for humans to do is problem solving and prompting the ideas in an expressive way.

## Wild thought?

Eventually CS as a field will become a niche like every other engineering field with limited applicability. Models will become so powerful that only a simple prompt will be enough for it to do anything you need to get done.
