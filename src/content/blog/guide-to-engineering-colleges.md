Navigating an engineering college can overwhelming sometimes. I am writing this from my own experiences. So take any advice in this blog with a grain of salt.

disclaimer - this post is not for people who have already figured out what they are interested in or are working on something great. This is for the people who feel that they are clueless and want to make the most out of college.

## The first step

If you have joined a college close to your house, then this might not be as relevant. But for those who have moved to a far away place, please make sure to fix a schedule.

There is a very quote from atomic habits - **You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.**

One of the most essential systems in your college life will be a schedule. It doesn't mean that you have to remove the fun out of it. In fact, add it as a definitive slot. Make it as long as you want.

## Go out

The best way to release any kind of mental pressure that I have found is going out. 

- Go for a walk (boosted if you go out with some friends)
- Go play a sport
- Go for a run or a jog

Just leave your room and go out. Time won't matter. 

## Of course you need some friends

This needs no telling and I don't think you will have any trouble making friends. Just make sure that you get some that are not like minded as you. This exposure will help you grow. 

## Branch matters

If fact, I would go out and say that it matters a lot. The branch you have got might not be what you wanted or what fits your skillset. The branch decides

- where you spend most of you waking time
- occupies a mental space that can't be discarded
- 4 years 

## Having fun

After sorting out the above mentioned points, optimise for having fun. This time is the last time where you will have no obligations to do anything. This will change in future as soon as you leave the college. Best luck with your journey
