## Introduction

Long ago, I had an opinion that I should be able to get what I want without working hard -- whatever that meant to me at that time. Now that I look back at that opinion, I feel that although I wasn't wrong, I wasn't right either.

I have always struggled to find meaning in this world. One way I tried to cope with it was to define short term goals and achieve them. This kept me occupied for a while. But when I stopped deriving meaning from this pursuit, I was again moving towards a nihilistic future. This is when I found Alex Hormozi.

## Hardwork is the Goal

Defining goals is not very simple, especially when the goal are vague and amorphous -- winning at life, being successful, etc. So the key insight I got from Alex's words was that we should (again, I am using should here, but none of this is a commandment) set behaviour as goals. This is for mainly two reasons - 

1. It is derived from the future self you desire to become. For example, say you want to become more expressive. The behaviour can be to write summaries everyday. Just do it and the behaviour will ensure that you become the person you desire.
2. Easier to track a behaviour. Measuring long term goals is really hard. This maybe because your monkey brain is not good at calculating really long term benefits.
