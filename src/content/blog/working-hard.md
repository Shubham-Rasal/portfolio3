Long ago, I had an opinion that I should be able to get what I want without working hard -- whatever that meant to me at that time. Now that I look back at that opinion, I feel that although I wasn't wrong, I wasn't right either.

I have always struggled to find meaning in this world. One way I tried to cope with it was to define short term goals and achieve them. This kept me occupied for a while. But when I stopped deriving meaning from this pursuit, I was again moving towards a nihilistic future. This is when I found [Alex Hormozi](https://www.youtube.com/c/alexhormozi).

## Hardwork is the Goal

Defining goals is not very simple, especially when the goal are vague and amorphous -- winning at life, being successful, etc. So the key insight I got from Alex's words was that we should (again, I am using *should* here, but none of this is a commandment) set behavior as goals. This is for mainly two reasons - 

1. **It is derived from the future self you desire to become.** 

For example, say you want to become more charismatic. Charisma is a bucket term for many things - talking slowly, greeting everyone when you enter a room, using people's names in the conversations often, etc. . The behavior can be to write summaries everyday. Just do it and the behavior will ensure that you become the person you desire.

2. **Easier to track a behavior.** 

Measuring long term goals is really hard. This maybe because your monkey brain is not good at calculating really long term benefits. 

I am particularly choosing working hard as my goal because it helps me measure myself accurately. I tend to compare myself a lot and this goal would give an outlet for that comparison. Although I still somewhat care about the outcome of the work that I put in, I plan to reduce it.

This ties surprisingly well into the *Karma* philosophy from *Bhagwat Geta*, at least in the way I interpret it.
